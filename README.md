# Caesar cipher / szyfr Cezara  

## About  

Console program written in C++ with use of standard libraries only. Allows you to encrypt/decrypt text with use of Caesar cipher. Polish UI.  

You can read about the Caesar cipher on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher  
  
When using the program, you will be asked to choose whether you want to encrypt, decrypt or crack the cipher. Next enter the input and output .txt filenames.  


## Features  

- Encrypt text from a .txt file and copy the results into a new .txt file  
- Choose how much should the alphabet "shift" (note: English alphabet used)  
- Look through the loaded .txt file with the ability to change loaded pages.  
- Decrypt .txt file and paste the results into a new .txt file (need to specify the "shift" beforehand).
